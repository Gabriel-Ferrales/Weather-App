# Weather Map App

The Weather Map App is a user-friendly web application built with React.js that provides users with current weather information and forecasts for a given city or their current geolocation. With just one button click or a city search, users can access detailed weather data, including temperature, air visibility, air pressure, humidity, and wind status for the next 5 days.
